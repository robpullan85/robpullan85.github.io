                      Welcome to my website, this is my first major website development which
                      has now become a primary project of mine to help develop my HTML, CSS and
                      JavaScript coding abilities. However, this will not be the only purpose of
                      this website, I shall talk about many subjects including myself, charity work,
                      current projects and much more. So, feel free to investigate my website which
                      will be in constant development. Thank you for visiting!

                      Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first
                      these were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and
                      later astronomy; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by
                      mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself.
                      For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral
                      formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical
                      reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a
                      still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four
                      fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.</div>
