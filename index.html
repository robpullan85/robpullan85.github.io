                      Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first
                      these were found in commerce, land measurement, architecture and
                      later astronomy; today, all sciences suggest problems studied by
                      mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself.
                      For example, the physicist Richard Feynman invented the path integral
                      formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical
                      reasoning and physical insight, and today's string theory, a
                      still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four
                      fundamental forces of nature, continues to inspire new mathematics.</div>
